I first started becoming interested in software development because of an internship I did after college at a start-up. It was a software company that specialized in marketing platforms, and, because I had previous experience in building computers - they hired me to do basic tech support and a little bit of HTML and CSS - which they mandated that I learn on the job.

By chance, I was seated next to our lead engineer and I would occassionally glance over at his screen, wondering what in the world Visual Basic was, or what ActiveRecord did. But the more I was exposed to basic code I began to realize that programing and coding had a sense of artful responsiblity to them - artful, because you could model programs to reflect the real world - and responsible, because obligation of writing and maintaining good code lay solely with the engineer. Programming, in my novice eyes, was very much like learning to fence: one's strength in wielding a sword correlated not just to how physically gifted one was, but to how much practice and time he was willing to invest in to improve himself. 

I both admired and envied our lead software engineer - my supervisor. He was born from a small village in India and raised himself out of poverty. He told me once that learning to code was a continual endeavor that could span a lifetime, but he also told me that above all, programming was in itself a beast that could only be mastered by discipline and perserverance in the face of failure. More of than not, my supervisor remarked, what distinguished a good programmer from a great programmer was not skill, but the desire to overcome that pesky bug that would rear its ugly head over and over at the computer screen.

I started to do more and more with HTML and CSS, and began teaching myself by studying code only and writing small-scale programs on the side. I pestered my supervisor whenever I could with question after question. I knew that I had to do this, that I had to at least try my hand at programming as a full-time effort. I was too intrigued with code.
